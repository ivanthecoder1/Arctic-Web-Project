# Arctic Website 

**This website was developed during my time at the All-Star Code summer program by a team of four. This website was created to raise awareness about the melting of the Arctic Ice Caps**

**Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, p5.js, BootStrap**

### Features ###
- Built-in platformer game with ten levels. Play as a mother polar bear who has to maneuver melting ice platforms to reach the final level and reunite with her cub. 
- Implemented an article section that fetches five articles related to climate change from the NYT API, and displayed them on the website for users to access
